when I was young and free and my imagination had no limits.

I dreamed of changing the world.

As I grew older and wiser, I disocvered the world would nor change.

So I shortened my sights somewhat and decided to change only my country.

But it too seemed immovable.

As I grew into my twilight years, in one last desperate attempt.

I settled for changing only family, those closest to me.

But alas, they would have none of it.

And now as I lay on my deathbed, I suddenly realise:

If I had only changed myself first.

Then, by example I would have change my family.

From their inspiration and encouragement.

I would then have been able to better my country.

And who knows, I may even have changed the world.
